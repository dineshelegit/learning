#Error handling with -k, -i, and i
#Add -k when running make to continue running even in the face of errors. Helpful if you want to see all the errors of Make at once. Add a "-" before a command to suppress the error Add "-i" to make to have this happen for every command.



#Recursive use of make (Section 5.6)
#Recursively call a makefile. Use the special $(MAKE) instead of "make" because it will pass the make flags for you and won't itself be affected by them.

Use export for recursive make (Section 5.6)
The export directive takes a variable and makes it accessible to sub-make commands. In this example, "cooly" is exported such that the makefile in subdir can use it.

Note: export has the same syntax as sh, but they aren't related (although similar in function)

new_content1 = "hello:\n\\techo \$$(cooly)"

recursive1:
	mkdir -p subdir
	echo $(new_content1) | sed -e 's/^ //' > subdir/makefile
	@echo "---MAKEFILE CONTENTS---"
	@cd subdir && cat makefile
	@echo "---END MAKEFILE CONTENTS---"
	cd subdir && $(MAKE)

# Note that variables and exports. They are set/affected globally.
cooly = "The subdirectory can see me!"
export cooly
# This would nullify the line above: unexport cooly

clean_recursive1:
	rm -rf subdir
	

#Another export example
#You need to export variables to have them run in the shell as well.

one=this will only work locally
export two=we can run subcommands with this
